        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Last week at work there was some chatter about how it had been a year since Taco Bell® took the 
            Triple Layer Nachos off their menu and how they were missed. I set out on a mission and this 
            is what I came up with. Note: the restaurant chain sells their own line of refried beans, 
            queso, and sauce so that makes it all the more easy to recreate this at home. This will 
            dirty 4 pans but it is so worth it!</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (16 ounce) can fat-free refried beans</li>
            <li>¼ cup water</li>
            <li>½ (15.5 ounce) jar prepared salsa con queso</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons water</li>
            <li>½ cup red enchilada sauce</li>
            <li>¼ cup Taco Bell® mild sauce</li>
            <li>½ cup vegetable oil</li>
            <li>12 (6 inch) white corn tortillas, cut into chips</li>
            <li>salt to taste</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Line a plate with paper towels.</li>
            <li>Combine refried beans and 1/4 cup water in a small saucepan over low heat.</li>
            <li>Combine salsa con queso and 2 tablespoons of water in a second saucepan and heat over low heat.</li>
            <li>Combine salsa con queso and 2 tablespoons of water in a second saucepan and heat over low heat.</li>
            <li>Preheat vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add tortilla chips to the skillet, making sure to not overcrowd. 
                Cook for 4 minutes, flipping halfway through. Use tongs and transfer chips to the paper towel-lined plate; sprinkle 
                with salt. Repeat with remaining chips.</li>
            <li>Divide chips between 4 serving dishes. Scatter beans on top of chips, drizzle with cheese, then drizzle with red sauce. Serve 
                immediately.</li>
        </ol>
